In Docker-based development, several containerization **patterns** exist depending on your goals: development, build, runtime, or CI/CD. 

Here are some **Docker usage patterns**, inspired by best practices and real-world workflows.

### 🚀 **1. Single-Stage Pattern (Monolithic)**

**Use Case:** Simple apps, scripts, or interpreted languages (e.g., Python, Node.js).

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

* ✅ Simple and fast
* ❌ Includes build tools in the final image (bloat)

### 🏗️ **2. Multi-Stage Build Pattern**

**Use Case:** Compiled languages or optimized production images.

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /src/myapp /app
CMD ["/app"]
```

* ✅ Small, secure final image
* ✅ Build-time dependencies discarded
* 🧠 Ideal for CI/CD or cloud deploys

### 🧪 **3. Docker as a Development Environment (Dev Container)**

**Use Case:** Local development environments, VSCode Dev Containers, consistent toolchains.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /workspace
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Mounted source code
* Live reload or hot recompile
* ✅ No need to install dev tools locally
* 📦 Great for onboarding teams

### 🔧 **4. Builder Pattern (Split Build + Runtime Containers)**

**Use Case:** Non-Docker-native build tools; needs fine control.

* Use a dedicated container just for compilation (e.g., Make, Gradle).
* Output copied to another base or distributed externally.
* Often used outside Dockerfiles, orchestrated by `docker-compose`, Makefiles, or shell scripts.

### 🌐 **5. Service Composition Pattern (Docker Compose)**

**Use Case:** Multi-container apps with dependencies (DB, cache, API, frontend, etc.)

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres
```

* ✅ Ideal for local dev or integration testing
* 🧩 Encourages service separation

### 🔄 **6. Sidecar Pattern**

**Use Case:** Attach helper containers (e.g., log shippers, proxy agents, TLS termination) to main apps—common in Kubernetes.

* Not common in raw Docker usage, but patterns can be simulated using `docker-compose` or shared volumes/networks.

### 🧱 **7. Layer Caching Pattern**

**Use Case:** Optimizing build time using smart ordering of `COPY` and `RUN` steps.

```Dockerfile
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
```

* ✅ Speeds up rebuilds by caching earlier layers
* ⚠️ Watch out for cache busting (e.g., changing `package.json`)

### 🧳 **8. Artifact-only Pattern**

**Use Case:** Build inside Docker, then extract artifacts to host for use outside Docker.

* Run container → copy compiled output → stop container
* E.g., used with C/C++/Rust for cross-compilation

| Pattern         | Use Case                         | Final Image Size | Ideal For                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Single-Stage    | Simple apps/scripts              | Medium-Large     | Prototyping, internal tools |
| Multi-Stage     | Production deployments           | Small            | Prod apps, CI/CD            |
| Dev Container   | Consistent dev setup             | Medium-Large     | Teams, open-source projects |
| Builder Pattern | Custom builds or toolchains      | Any              | CI/CD pipelines             |
| Docker Compose  | Multi-service local environments | Varies           | Web apps, microservices     |
| Sidecar         | Support containers for main app  | N/A              | Monitoring, proxies         |
| Layer Caching   | Faster rebuilds                  | N/A              | All builds                  |
